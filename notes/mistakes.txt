# Common mistakes
* Edge cases
  * empty list?
  * negative value?
* Scalability
  * Integer that exceeds the limit
  * Super long lists/strings
* Work in-place instead of creating expensive intermediate data structures
* Know your Integer limits and binary operations!
* Bad text input
  * empty string
  * negative
  * Repeated specail char or special char in wrong place ( +12.3 => ++12.3.4 )
  * Out of int bound
  * spaces
* Don't forget to return the result
* Be careful about substring indexing, especially s[-x:] if x == 0 then it will be the whole string, but you might want the empty string at the end

# Tips
* Use bit array ([0 1 0 1 0]) to save time (no list.append), or use sparse address list to save space ([ 1 2 ])
